# TNLP with TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, and Universal Sentence Encoder
This notebook presents a comprehensive journey through modern NLP pipelines, starting from traditional machine learning with scikit-learn to advanced deep learning models using TensorFlow.
We begin with the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) for feature extraction, and then build deeper models using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTM, GRU, and Bidirectional LSTM for tasks such as binary text classification.
This project offers a solid foundation for applying deep learning to text — from embeddings to sequence modeling.

🚀 Features:

✅ Baseline NLP model using:

    * TfidfVectorizer (Scikit-learn)

    * Multinomial Naive Bayes

✅ Pre-trained embedding via Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)

✅ Deep learning models with TensorFlow & Keras:

    * 🔁 LSTM

    * 🔁 GRU

    * 🔁 Bidirectional LSTM
